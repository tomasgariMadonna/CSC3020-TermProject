Student Portfolio tracker
The Student Portfolio Tracker is a simple web application that allows students to upload projects, list their skills, and showcase achievements in one organized place. It solves the problem of students not having a central, professional platform to display their work beyond resumes. By providing an easy way to track and present accomplishments, it helps students stand out to potential employers or academic programs.
